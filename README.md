# Continual-Learning-for-Chest-X-ray-Disease-Classification
A PyTorch-based continual learning system for chest X-ray disease detection using Montgomery, COVIDx, and NIH datasets. Combines ResNet18, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), autoencoder-based anomaly detection, and Grad-CAM visualization for interpretable, memory-preserving medical image classification.
